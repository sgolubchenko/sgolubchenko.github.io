				<div class="page-content"> I hold Bachelor and Master degrees in Asian and African Studies with Japanese History and Culture as a major. My thesis projects were on illustrated guidebooks of the Kansai region, infrastructure for tourism and pilgrimage in the Edo period. In the course of my research, I worked mainly with compiling data bases, statistical processing of the data and geographical and historical description of provinces. I also have some experience studying abroad, since I was a one-year exchange student at the Waseda University in Tokyo at the first year of my Master program.
					<br /> In autumn 2019, I started my PhD research on social management technologies, government’s policies and support schemes to overcome regional inequality in Japan. The aim of the research is to analyze and identify the most effective ways to contribute to regional revitalization and reducing inequalities, to improve accessibility of education, information security, incomes, health status for the entire population and for the peripheral regions in particular.
					<br /> During the course of my education, I gained some professional experience through several internships as an assistant and content intern, where I conducted academic research, editing, information gathering, fact-checking and managing correspondence.
					<br /> Alongside with my studies, from the period of high school I regularly take part in scientific conferences and international projects, mainly focused on history, politics, problems of youth, equality and sustainable development both as a participant and a volunteer.

				<div class="page-content"> As my major during B.A. and M.A. programs was Japanese History and Culture, I Learned Japanese language as a philologist for six years. In addition, I studied on Japanese Language Program at the Waseda University for a year. Therefore, I obtained a profound knowledge on grammar and structure of the language, as well as language proficiency in the sphere of academic writing and speaking, business and honorific speech.
					<br /> At present, I have a 2 years experience of teaching Japanese. I worked not only with individuals, but also with groups from 3 to 5 people of different ages (adults, children aged 10-15). During this period, I managed to:
					<br />
					<br /> - create 2 mobile apps for beginners [links]
					<br /> - develop a 6-months express course for beginners, tested on students [link]
					<br /> - develop an introductory express course on the basis of manga [link] </div>
