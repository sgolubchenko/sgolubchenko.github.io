				<div class="page-content"> I am a first-year PhD student in sociology, conducting reserach on Regional Development and Social Governance Technologies. I started my higher education with a history as a major, which gave me a profound knowledge about different cultures, international relations and social processes. Recently, I decided to pursue my education in social science, because I believe it will help me to contribute to solving problems of inequality, undeveloped regions and to ensure better standarts of living of the whole population.
					<br />
					<br /> Moreover, I have enjoyed learning languages since my childhood and have interest in linguistics. At present, I speak fluently four languages (Russian, English, Japanese and French) and always open for new languages.

				<div class="page-content"> I hold Bachelor and Master degrees in Asian and African Studies with Japanese History and Culture as a major. My thesis projects were on illustrated guidebooks of the Kansai region, infrastructure for tourism and pilgrimage in the Edo period. In the course of my research, I worked mainly with compiling data bases, statistical processing of the data and geographical and historical description of provinces. I also have some experience studying abroad, since I was a one-year exchange student at the Waseda University in Tokyo at the first year of my Master program.
					<br />
					<br /> In autumn 2019, I started my PhD research on social management technologies, government’s policies and support schemes to overcome regional inequality in Japan. The aim of the research is to analyze and identify the most effective ways to contribute to regional revitalization and reducing inequalities, to improve accessibility of education, information security, incomes, health status for the entire population and for the peripheral regions in particular.
					<br />
					<br /> During the course of my education, I gained some professional experience through several internships as an assistant and content intern, where I conducted academic research, editing, information gathering, fact-checking and managing correspondence.
					<br />
					<br /> Alongside with my studies, from the period of high school I regularly take part in scientific conferences and international projects, mainly focused on history, politics, problems of youth, equality and sustainable development both as a participant and a volunteer.
